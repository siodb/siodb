Plan for developing initial implementation of the "User Permissions" feature

(+) 1. Read permissions on startup.
(+) 2. Populate permissions into User object.
(+) 3. Parse permission control SQL.
(+) 4. Handle grant and revoke permission requests.
(+) 5. Auto-grant permissions during certain operations (CREATE DATABASE, CREATE TABLE).
(+) 6. Auto-revoke permissions during certain operations (DROP DATABASE, DROP TABLE).
(+) 7. Check permissions on each operation.
(>) 8. SHOW PERMISSIONS

LEGEND:
not marked = pending
(>) = in progress
(+) = done

- Permission tests:
  - (+) SELECT
  - INSERT
  - UPDATE
  - DELETE
  - UPDATE
  - CREATE TABLE
  - DROP TABLE
  - ALTER TABLE
  - CREATE DATABASE
  - DROP DATABASE
  - ALTER DATABASE
  - GRANT
  - REVOKE
  - GRANT WITH GRANT OPTION
  - Test that granted with grant option works
  - SHOW USER PERMISSIONS

Tests above (permitted variant) should be implemented for:
  - Single database + single table
  - Single database + all tables
  - All databases + all tables
