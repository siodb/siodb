Plan for developing initial implementation of the "User Permissions" feature

(+) 1. Read permissions on startup.
(+) 2. Populate permissions into User object.
(+) 3. Parse permission control SQL.
(+) 4. Handle grant and revoke permission requests.
(+) 5. Auto-grant permissions during certain operations (CREATE DATABASE, CREATE TABLE).
(+) 6. Auto-revoke permissions during certain operations (DROP DATABASE, DROP TABLE).
7. Check permissions on each operation.
