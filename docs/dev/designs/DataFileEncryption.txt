SIODB DATA FILE ENCRYPTION
=============================

1. Below stated requirements for Siodb encryption apply to Siodb data files.
   Following data files will be encrypted:
   - Data block files
   - Index files
   - System table information data files

2. These requirements are NOT about securing traffic between Siodb client and server and between
   Siodb processes. These things are subject to separate specification.

3. We identify "cipher" with a CIPHER_ID which is a single string that includes:
     - Encryption algorithm name
     - Key size
     - Block size, if mutiple block sizes allowed.
   Examples:
     - "aes128" - AES with key size 128 bits.
     - "aes256" - AES with key size 256 bits.
     - "rijndael128_256" - Rijndael with key size 128 bits and block size 256 bits.
   Note: AES uses algorithm called Rijndael, but AES standartizes block size 128 bits.
   On its own, Rijndael algorithm allows more block sizes.

4. Per-database cipher parameters are stored in separate columns in the SYS_DATABASES table:
     - CIPHER_ID - stores cipher identification string, as described above
     - CIPHER_KEY - store encryption key

5. We can specify the cipher parameters in the CREATE DATABASE statement as follows:
     - CREATE DATABASE abcd WITH
            CIPHER_ID='aes128',
            CIPHER_KEY_SEED = 'fksgksgjrekgjerkglerjg';
   If we skip such specification, default cipher and other default parameters are used.

6. Default cipher can be specified in the Siodb instance config file with following parameter:
     - encryption.default_cipher_id
   If this parameter is not explicitly specified, effective default cipher must be 'aes128'.

7. Default seed string will be "siodb" (all lowercase ASCII letters).

8. Encyption algorithm used to encrypt system database is specified by the following
   configuration parameter:
     - encryption.system_db_cipher_id
   If it is not specified explicitly, effective default cipher is used.

9. Encryption key for the new database is generated through cyclic hashing of entropy data pool,
   which includes following elements:
      - CIPHER_KEY_SEED
      - Current system time
      - at least 32 bytes from the system random number source (/dev/urandom).
   Number of hashing cycles is determined randomly based on the additional 2 bytes,
   read from the /dev/urandom, which are treated as little endian unsigned integer. That integer
   is added 32768, and result will be a number of hasing cycles to derive encryption key.
   Hash algorithm:
      - SHA-256 for generation of keys up to 256 bits
      - SHA-512 for generation of keys up to 512 bits
   If required key size X is shorter than outcome of hash function, first X bits are taken as a key.

10. Siodb internal architecture must permit us to use virtually any block cipher.

11. Siodb must provide set of built-in AES and Camellia variations to target US and EU users OOB.
   Siodb will also provide built-in cipher called 'none' which means no encryption.

12. Siodb must use OpenSSL implementations of the AES and Camellia ciphers, SHA-256 and SHA-512 hash
   functions and will not contain any own code that implements cryptographic primitives.

13. We will change Siodb configuration storage to 
    /etc/siodb/instances/<instance name>/, which will currently contain following files:
      - config - Siodb configuration file
      - system_db_key - encryption key for the system database as a signle-line hex format string 

14. Siodb must check at startup that all known configuration files, located in the current instance
    configuration folder, meet following conditions:
      - They are owned by the user "siodb" and group "siodb".
      - Noone has execute access to those files.
      - Owner user has read access to those files.
      - Other users and groups don't have any access to those files.
      - (RELEASE build only) Owner group members don't have any access to those files.

15. (NOT FOR RELEASE 1). Siodb must allow third-party cipher implementations to be used for
    encryption of databases. To do this, Siodb will allow loading of plugin modules with
    cipher implementations. Following confihuration parameters will apply:
      - encryption.plugins - comma-separated list of encryption plugin codenames
      - encryption.plugin.<plugin name>.path - path to plugin shared library
      - encryption.plugin.<plugin_name>.enrty_point - name of the entry point function that
        can be located with dladdr(3).
      - encryption.plugin.<plugin_name>.config.* - configuration entries for the plugin.
   Exact API for entry point function to be specified later.

Implementation Notes
=======================

1. Encryption and decryption is implemented must be implemented trasparently on the
   file descriptor I/O level. Sequnce of actions in the business logic code must not be changed.

2. To achieve item #10 we will keep list of known built-in ciphers with implementation of the single
   and multiple block encryption and decryption operations. Later on (but not in the "Release 1"
   demo version), we may decide to introduce encryption plugins that provide one or more
   additional ciphers (see item #15).
