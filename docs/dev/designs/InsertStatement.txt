INSERT STATEMENT
=========================

##1. OVERVIEW

Insert statement adds new data row to a table.
Here we describe algorithm that is used by Siodb to implement it.


##2. CONFIGURATION PARAMETERS

Table lock timeout - timeout in which table lock must be obtained.


##3. ALGORITHM

1. If database name is not empty, validate it, indicate error if it is invalid.

2. Validate table name, indicate error if table name is invalid.

3. Check for system table name, if it is detected, report error - can't insert
into system table.

Hint: class Database has set of system table names. We may need to add new
public static method to make this check using it.

4. Validate column names, indicate error if at least column name is invalid.
   Generate separate error message for each invalid column name.

5. Check that all column names are unique. Report separate error message for
each duplicate column.

6. Get designated database and obtain read lock for it. If database name
   is empty, use database SYS. Indicate error of database cannot be immediately
   read-locked.

See document about SELECT statement for details.

7. Obtain table from database and read-lock it. 

See document about SELECT statement for details.

8. Lock table itself.

See document about SELECT statement for details.

9. Obtain master column object.

See document about SELECT statement for details.

10. Resolve column objects for each column in the insert request. If some column
   cannot be resolved, indicate error. Generate separate error message for
   each unresolved column. Build list of column objects as result of this step.

12. Initialize MasterColumnRecord data structure with new TRID.

13. Save current "next data position" of master column.

14. For each table column:
  - If value specified, convert it to siodb::iomgr::dbengine::Variant.
  - Save current "next data position" of the column
  - Write value into column, add returned data position to master column record.

15. Write master column record.

16. Repeat steps 13-15 for until provided data ends. 

17. If error (std::exception) happens during this process (steps 13 - 15),
    rollback columns where data already written to a last saved point.

See example of something similar in method Database::recordTable()
