# Administration

## Configuration file

Siodb identifies an instance by its name.
With the name of an instance, you can locate its configuration file.
Siodb expects to find the configuration file of an instance in the folder
`/etc/siodb/instances/<INSTANCE_NAME>/`.
All files below must be present at each startup time:

- `/etc/siodb/instances/<INSTANCE_NAME>/config`: The Siodb parameter files.
- `/etc/siodb/instances/<INSTANCE_NAME>/master_key`: The master encryption key
  for Siodb.

The file below must be present at the first startup time to indicate Siodb which
public key to use for the Siodb `root` user:

- `/etc/siodb/instances/<INSTANCE_NAME>/initial_access_key`

## Installation directory

The default installation directory is `/opt/siodb-<VERSION>`.
This is the home directory of Siodb for a given release Id.
You can find the Siodb binaries in `${SIODB_HOME}/bin`.

## Authentication

To authenticate yourself to the server, you must have [an active user created
in Siodb with an active access key](users.md).

## Start an instance of Siodb

To start and stop an instance of Siodb you must respect the following rules:

- Use the `siodb` binary.
- Be connected with the `siodb` user.
- Use the `--instance <instance_name>` parameter to tell Siodb which parameter
  file it must use.

```bash
$ /opt/siodb-<VERSION>/bin/siodb --help
Allowed options:
  -i [ --instance ] arg Instance name
  -d [ --daemon ]       Run as daemon
  -h [ --help ]         Produce help message
```

## Connect with the command line client

You can connect to an instance with the `siocli` client. There are two connection
modes, the local mode with a Unix socket and the remote mode over TCP/IP.

```bash
$ /opt/siodb-<VERSION>/bin/siocli --help
Allowed options:
  -a [ --admin ] arg                    Connect to given instance in the admin mode
  -H [ --host ] arg (=localhost)        Server host name or IP address
  -p [ --port ] arg (=50000)            Server port
  -k [ --keep-going ]                   Keep going if stdin is pipe or file and error occurred
  -i [ --identity-file ] arg (=/home/siodb/.ssh/id_rsa)
                                        Identity file (client private key)
  -u [ --user ] arg (=siodb)            User name
  -h [ --help ]                         Produce help message
```

## Connect to an instance with the admin mode

To connect to an instance of Siodb you use must respect the following rules:

- Use the `siocli` executable.
- Use the option `--admin` to connect locally. In the admin mode, the connection
is local and uses a Unix socket to communicate with Siodb.

## Connect to an instance over TCP/IP

To connect to a remote instance of Siodb, you must provide the network identifier
of the remote instance. This can be the hostname (`--host`) or an IP with the
port number (`--port`).

Example of a remote connection:

```bash
nico@siodb:~$ /opt/siodb-0.6/bin/siocli --host 192.168.56.50 --port 50000 --user nico --identity-file .ssh/id_rsa
Siodb client v.0.6.0

siocli> select name from sys_databases ;
Connected to 192.168.56.50:50000
NAME
--------------------
                 SYS

1 rows.
Command execution time: 45 ms.
```

If you don't provide the username and the identity file, `siocli` will use your current
OS username and the first private key found into the `.ssh` locate in your home. For instance:

```bash
nico@siodb:~$ /opt/siodb-0.6/bin/siocli --host 192.168.56.50 --port 50000
Siodb client v.0.6.0

siocli> select name from sys_databases ;
Connected to 192.168.56.50:50000
NAME
--------------------
                 SYS
